<h1> Menu App with Flask, a Python mini framework </h1>

<p>In this project you will find a restaurant menu web application, which I wrote using a python miniframework Flask.
The web application lists all the restaurants in the database and allows you to see the menu of the each restaurant. 
User can also add, edit, delete a restaurant as well as a new menu item to the menu of each restaurant.</p>

<p> In this project you will find a file lotsofmenus.py which you can run first to populate a database: python lotsofmenus.py </p>

<p> After, you can run the file: python finalproject.py and see the app in your http://localhost:5000/ </p>
